# Live Train Location of Finland website

This is a website that retrieves real-time train location (almost, as it is set to fetch every 10 seconds haha) from [DigiTraffic API](https://www.digitraffic.fi/en/) and it shows the location in the map. The website allows the user to search for trains with the train Number, display real-time in the marker popup while also showing the samne information in a side-bar which also displays extra information fetched from the train metadata.

## Features
1. **Real-time Train Location Updates**:
   - Fetches train location data from the DigiTraffic API and updates the map every 10 seconds.
2. **Interactive Map UI**:
   - Displays train locations on a map using `react-leaflet`.
3. **Search Functionality**:
   - Users can search for specific trains.
4. **Train Details Sidebar**:
   - Shows metadata, including speed, category, departure and destination information for selected trains.
5. **Automatic Data Refresh**:
   - Automatically fetches and updates train locations in the background

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend Framework**: React.js
- **Map Library**: React-Leaflet
- **API**: DigiTraffic Railway Traffic API
- **Styling**: Custom CSS
- **Other Libraries**:
  - `Leaflet` for marker icons
  - `useState` and `useEffect` hooks for state management
  - `useCallback` to optimize performance
